# Update Homebrew Formula
#
# This workflow generates the Homebrew formula with correct SHA256 hashes
# after release binaries are uploaded to GitHub Releases.
#
# Trigger options:
#   1. Automatic: Runs after "Build and Release Binaries" workflow completes successfully
#   2. Manual: Use workflow_dispatch with a version number
#
# The workflow creates a PR rather than committing directly to avoid
# conflicts with internal sync processes.
